# Maji NdogoWater discripancies-analysis using Looker

## The dashboard's tasks 
The task is to visualize national water survey results, including basic access levels, aggregated improvements (by count and cost), and rural/urban distribution across provinces.
## Goals 
 Its goals are to offer a comprehensive overview, identify frequent and costly improvements, analyze financial investments, understand rural/urban disparities, assess provincial needs, and inform future strategic decisions for water projects.

### The Maji Ndogo Water National Survey Dashboard answered the following questions

1.	How many people have gained access to improved water services across different provinces?
2.	Which provinces have the highest and lowest number of people served?
3.	What is the rural vs. urban distribution of water improvements?
4.	How much funding has been allocated to different types of improvements?
5.	Which provinces received the highest and lowest funding?
6.	Which improvements received the most and least investment?
7.	What types of water infrastructure improvements were implemented?
8.	Which intervention method was used the most?
9.	How efficient were these interventions in improving water access?
10.	Are existing systems being maintained, or is the focus mainly on new infrastructure?
11.	Which regions still face significant water access challenges despite improvements?

### The process taken to analyse the Maji Ndogo Water data

## Recommendations
- Strategic Investment in Drill Wells: While costly per instance, drill wells address fundamental access issues and should be strategically implemented in areas with limited existing infrastructure, especially in rural regions where the need is highest.
- Optimize Filter Installation: Given the high number of RO and UV filter installations, explore cost-effective bulk procurement or local manufacturing options to reduce the per-unit cost while maintaining water quality standards.
- Prioritize Infrastructure Repair: Repairing existing infrastructure appears to be a relatively cost-effective improvement with significant impact, suggesting a focus on maintenance can yield good returns.
- Targeted Public Tap Installation: Public tap installations are a substantial investment. Further analysis could identify optimal locations for new taps to maximize reach and minimize cost, potentially by leveraging existing community hubs.
- Address Rural Disparity: Continue the strong focus on rural areas, as they still represent the largest percentage of improvements needed across provinces. Tailor solutions to specific rural challenges, considering factors like terrain and population density.
