# Maji NdogoWater discripancies-analysis using Looker

## The dashboard's tasks 
The task is to visualize national water survey results, including basic access levels, aggregated improvements (by count and cost), and rural/urban distribution across provinces.
## Goals 
 Its goals are to offer a comprehensive overview, identify frequent and costly improvements, analyze financial investments, understand rural/urban disparities, assess provincial needs, and inform future strategic decisions for water projects.

### The Maji Ndogo Water National Survey Dashboard answered the following questions

1.	How many people have gained access to improved water services across different provinces?
2.	Which provinces have the highest and lowest number of people served?
3.	What is the rural vs. urban distribution of water improvements?
4.	How much funding has been allocated to different types of improvements?
5.	Which provinces received the highest and lowest funding?
6.	Which improvements received the most and least investment?
7.	What types of water infrastructure improvements were implemented?
8.	Which intervention method was used the most?
9.	How efficient were these interventions in improving water access?
10.	Are existing systems being maintained, or is the focus mainly on new infrastructure?
11.	Which regions still face significant water access challenges despite improvements?

### The process taken to analyse the Maji Ndogo Water data
- Outlined the problem: Water access disparities in various provinces.
- Explain the goal: Identify gaps, improvements, and budget efficiency.
- Cleaned and validated records to ensure accuracy in population numbers and budget allocations.
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Dashboard Design & Development
- Chose visualization tools: i.e. Looker, 
- Created charts, maps, and summary tables for easy interpretation.
- Structured key sections: Budget Allocation, Infrastructure Improvements, Urban vs Rural Comparison.

## Keys Findings

### Overview & Key KPIs
The national water survey reveals a significant rural focus in water improvement efforts, with 72.58% of improvements directed towards rural areas compared to 20.40% for urban areas. The total budgeted cost for improvements across all aggregated categories is $40,151,475.

### Answers 
1.	Total impact: 27.6M people served through various interventions.
2.	Kilimani (4.7M people served) has the highest access, while Hawassa (2.69M) has the least.
3.	Rural areas received more investment (Sokoto 79.89%, Akatsi 87.72% rural).
4.	$147M total budget, with major funding for drilling wells ($19.8M) and public taps ($8.2M).
5.	Sokoto ($40.15M) received the most, while Amanzi ($13.42M) had the lowest allocation.
6.	Well drilling ($19.8M) was the top priority, while infrastructure repairs ($381K) received minimal funding.
7.	Well drilling, public taps, RO & UV filters, and infrastructure repairs.
8.	Drilling wells (1,709 projects) was the most common, showing reliance on groundwater.
9.	Investments favored expansion rather than repair, raising sustainability concerns.
10.	How investment in repairs ($381K) suggests a focus is on expansion rather than sustainability.
11.	Hawassa and Akatsi have lower water access compared to high-funded areas like Kilimani.

### Aggregated Improvements Breakdown
